# Asynchronous Website Status and Uptime Monitoring powered by PYthon
Awsum is a python script which can monitor the uptime and the status of the websites selected and then export it into a csv.

Because of some functions using UNIX signals (BaseEventLoop.add_signal_handler from asyncio module), the code doesn't work properly (or at all) on Windows or other non-UNIX systems.
